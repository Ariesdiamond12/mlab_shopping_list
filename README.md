# Shopping List

- I created a shopping list using ReactJS and VITE
- The shopping list is a simple application that allows users to add, remove, and edit items (CRUD operations)
- The application uses a state to store the shopping list items and a function to handle the CRUD operations
- The application uses React Hooks to manage the state and side effects
- The application uses a simple UI to display the shopping list items and allow users to interact with them
- I used Redux for state management and React Router for routing
- I used a simple API to fetch data from a server and display it in the application
- I used a simple API to send data to a server and update the application state
